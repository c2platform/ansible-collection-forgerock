# Note the README.md and wiki: due to the specific scenario building up a 2-node cluster,
# this replicate part will  be skipped if the node is not config_master.
# And it's strongly recommended to provision the not_config_master node BEFORE provisioning the config_master node.
# (There is a sanity check on board to handle human errors here.)
